Hi friend,

I <a href="ilovevizag.html">love</a> Vizag. My dream is to make every graduate from Vizag
to get a job. But many people are without a job after
graduation. They think Ameerpet is the solution for their
fate, but it is not true. It's full of black holes. Which
just absorb your money, time and energy of your precious 
years. 

I think instead you should head to Anakapalli. Anakapalli
has a sun, Mr. Ravi Kumar Sir. Under his guidance, in few
months you will gain the needed energy and velocity to
escape from your current state. You will gain needed
capabilities and confidence. You will not only have a job
in hand, but also have the capability to learn new things.
This rare capability is much valued in the industry. You
will raise to great heights in your career.

Ok, what does a company expect from you? Do you have the
capability to write algorithms for new problems? Do you
have the capability to learn new things? Do you have the
capability to communicate with team mates? Do you have the
attitude to work and get it done? 

If you want to gain the capabilites needed to get a job
then go to Anakapalli and learn from Ravi Sir. Just 3
things are needed
1. Desire to learn programming
2. A laptop
3. What ever amount you like to give

I have seen 6 students of Ravi Sir who are doing great
job in their companies. I personally referred 3 people
in the last year, who are working now in companies with
great confidence. You can <a href="ravisirstudents.html">check their experiences here</a>.
I wish you have a great career like them.

If you have any questions, or there's anything I can do to
make you successful, <a href="mailto:rohini.kumar@gmail.com">please get in touch</a> 9492235028.
Thank you!

Regards,
Rohini Barla

Address of Ravi Sir's Lab:
House-No: 13-73, Sai Laxmi Nilayam,
Maduranagar, Anakapalli - 531001
