I joined at Ravi Kumar sir training in Jan 2016. He is fantastic person. He has more than 20 years software industry experience. If you completed training successfully, he can refer for software companies. Successfully completed means, not conducting exams and pass marks. There is no teacher to pass or fail us. There only a trainer and he is Ravi Kumar sir. He just a trainer. He does ask you that hey you didn't complete work till now and why didn't you complete work like this. If you want to learn, he just guide you and will explain doubts. I learnt a lot there. We can easily identify our self that  how we are before joining there and how we after complete training. We will get more confidence our self after complete training. He teaches like how a software engineer should be like and what attitude he/she should have known. He teaches from basic Knowledge that means students don't need to be very good or knowing computer knowledge . Basic knowledge is enough. The students who are good at hardworking, this is right place to learn I think. I started from basics there like addition, subtraction, multiplication, even number, odd numbers, prime numbers, bigger of two numbers, etc. I think everyone knows these basics. We start there by writing algorithms for those basic concepts. We no need of worry about writing algorithm. First he tell us how to write algorithm for 2,3 examples. And he later he give basic problems and we have to write algorithms for these. We should have only two things. OneAnd later he teaches how to  write C programs and how exactly a software engineer should know. And later on words we can learn writing programs in Java, python, php SQL, HTML, JavaScript, etc. And he teaches how to MySql and Oracle databases and also do a real time project like how to store item details in shopping malls and how access particular item by using item ids and how to maintain database of shopping malls. There we do some real time and industry oriented projects. I learned all these things and later I learned MVC, Jsp, Servlets, etc. At the training, the environment is like freedom and there is no force on student to learn. If you doing what he give then you will definitely complete training within 3 months. Finally everyone can be acceptable by Ravi Kumar sir training unless you want to learn something new and blindly follow him and you will definitely get a good job.
